# SwinDepth-T

Official repository for **"SwinDepth-T: Revolutionizing Monocular Depth Estimation with Hierarchical Transformer-Based Multi-Scale Feature Fusion"**.

## Overview
SwinDepth-T is a hierarchical Transformer-based model designed for monocular depth estimation. It combines:
- Shifted Window Attention
- Multi-Scale Feature Fusion Attention Module (MSFA-Net)
- Lightweight and scalable encoder-decoder architecture

## Highlights
- Linear computational complexity with respect to image size
- Supports KITTI and NYU Depth v2 datasets
- Compact, Simple, and Standard variants (31Mâ€“93M params)
- State-of-the-art accuracy with reduced inference time

##  Structure
- `train.py`: Training script
- `test.py`: Evaluation script
- `models/`: Model definitions
- `configs/`: Hyperparameters
- `weights/`: Pretrained models
- `utils/`: Helper functions and evaluation metrics

## Getting Started
